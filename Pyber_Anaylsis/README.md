Summary: 


Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


1.	Re-appropriate drivers from urban and suburban areas to offer rider services in rural areas. 

2.	Increase marketing efforts in rural areas specifically towards riders. Continue to increase the total number of riders in rural areas 

3.	To assist urban drivers specifically, increase the fare to use services. Because urban city is the largest revenue generate the increase in fare will help aid the drivers.
